  <h1>Youth of Color Transforming Power Through Digital Media</h1>
  <p>
    I argue that youth media engagement is a source of power—not harm.  
    Through digital platforms, young people challenge stereotypes,
    organize resistance, and build identity outside traditional institutions.

      <h2>The Issue</h2>

      <h2>The Issue</h2>
      <p>
        Mainstream media has long portrayed racially minoritized youth through harmful deficit narratives. These portrayals often frame youth of color as “at risk,” dangerous, irresponsible, or unsuccessful, while ignoring their creativity, intelligence, leadership, and resilience. News outlets, television, and even school systems often focus on crime, failure, and dysfunction rather than on joy, activism, learning, and community strength.
        <br><br>
        These stereotypes do not stay on the screen — they shape how society treats youth of color and how youth begin to see themselves. When young people constantly encounter negative portrayals, it affects their confidence, identity development, and sense of belonging. This creates a cycle where harmful media narratives reinforce racial inequality in education, policing, and opportunity.
        <br><br>
        My project examines how youth use digital activism and critical media literacy to disrupt this cycle by pushing back against these stereotypes and creating their own representations online.

      <h2>My Position</h2>

      <h2>My Position</h2>
      <p>
        While many adults argue that social media is harmful to youth, I take a different position:
        <br><br>
        Digital spaces are not just sites of danger — they are powerful sites of resistance, identity-building, and political learning for youth of color.
        <br><br>
        I argue that social media gives young people tools to:
        <br>
        Speak for themselves instead of being spoken for<br>
        Challenge racist portrayals<br>
        Build community and solidarity<br>
        Learn how power, media, and representation work
        <br><br>
        Youth are not passive consumers of content. They are active creators, organizers, and educators who use platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube to challenge injustice, share lived experiences, and organize for change. For youth of color especially, digital spaces become places where they can reclaim control over their image and their narrative.

      <h2>What I Found</h2>

    <div class="flip-back small-text">
      <h2>What I Found</h2>
      <p>
        Through my research on youth digital activism and media engagement, I found that:
        <br><br>
        1. Youth Learn to Recognize and Rewrite Stereotypes
        <br>
        Critical media literacy helps young people identify biased, racist, or misleading portrayals in mainstream media. Once they recognize these patterns, they don’t just critique them — they actively rewrite them through their own videos, art, music, and storytelling.
        <br><br>
        2. Digital Media Builds Identity and Solidarity
        <br>
        Youth use online platforms to explore racial, cultural, and gender identity while connecting with others who share similar experiences. These spaces allow youth of color to feel seen and supported in ways that traditional institutions often fail to provide.
        <br><br>
        3. Digital Activism Builds Political Awareness
        <br>
        Many youth grow political consciousness online by learning about injustice, organizing protests, sharing educational content, and amplifying community issues. Their activism is not random — it is intentional, informed, and deeply connected to real-world struggles.
        <br><br>
        4. Reclaiming Identity Is a Form of Resistance
        <br>
        Youth grow up inside systems that often stereotype them. When they use digital spaces to represent themselves positively and truthfully, that act itself becomes resistance against racism and misrepresentation.

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="flip-back small-text">
      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        This work matters because media shapes how young people understand themselves and their place in society. When youth of color only see negative portrayals, it limits their sense of possibility. But when they control their stories, they challenge racism at its root — the level of representation and perception.
        <br><br>
        Youth digital activism shows that:
        <br>
        Learning does not only happen in classrooms<br>
        Political awareness begins early<br>
        Young people are already shaping the future of justice and media
        <br><br>
        By telling their own stories, youth:
        <br>
        Fight racial stereotypes<br>
        Build confidence and leadership<br>
        Create new visions of what youth of color can be
        <br><br>
        Their voices do not just change online spaces — they influence schools, communities, and movements. Recognizing youth as producers of knowledge and culture, not just consumers, is essential for building a more just and truthful society.
