<h1>Key Concepts Through Youth Experiences</h1>

    <h2>Model Minority Myth</h2>
    <p>
      You may have heard things like “Your group always does well” or “You don’t face
      real problems.” While these comments sound positive, they can be harmful.
      <br><br>
      Research on youth digital activism shows that the model minority myth pressures
      youth to appear successful, quiet, and problem-free even when they experience
      racism, stress, and mental health struggles.
      <br><br>
      Social media has become a powerful space where youth push back against this myth.
      By sharing personal stories, calling out inequality, and organizing around issues
      like education and immigration, young people show the full complexity of their
      lives instead of a “perfect” image.

    <h2>Microaggressions</h2>
    <p>
      Microaggressions are small comments or actions that may not seem harmful at first,
      but still leave a lasting impact.
      <br><br>
      Comments like “Where are you really from?” or “You’re so articulate” can make
      youth of color feel like they don’t fully belong.
      <br><br>
      Social media gives youth a space to name these experiences, share stories, and
      realize they are not alone. Through posts, videos, and hashtags, young people turn
      personal moments of everyday racism into collective awareness and digital activism.

    <h2>Third Space</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes school feels restrictive. Sometimes home does too.
      <br><br>
      Digital spaces can act as “third spaces” places outside of those environments
      where youth can explore identity, culture, creativity, and power more freely.
      <br><br>
      On social media, youth of color build supportive communities, express themselves
      authentically, and engage in activism that challenges dominant narratives about
      who they are and what they can do.

  <div class="concept-content">
    <h2>Digital Activism</h2>
    <p>
      Activism does not only happen in classrooms or on the streets.
      <br><br>
      Research shows that youth use hashtags, videos, comment threads, and storytelling
      to organize protests, educate others, and mobilize their peers.
      <br><br>
      Platforms like TikTok and Instagram allow youth of color to expose injustice,
      share counter-stories, and build movements that begin online but often influence
      real-world change.

    <h2>Critical Media Literacy</h2>
    <p>
      Not everything online is neutral or fair.
      <br><br>
      Critical media literacy helps youth question who created a message, whose voices
      are missing, and why certain stereotypes keep appearing.
      <br><br>
      Youth of color use these skills to respond creatively producing content that
      challenges bias and replaces harmful portrayals with stories rooted in their own
      experiences, strength, and truth.
