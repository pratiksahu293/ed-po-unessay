    <h2>Model Minority Myth</h2>
<p>
Research on youth digital activism shows that the model minority myth pressures Asian youth to appear successful, quiet, and problem-free, even when they face real discrimination and mental health struggles. Social media has become a key space where Asian youth challenge this narrative by sharing personal stories, exposing inequality, and organizing around issues like racism, immigration, and education. Through TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, youth use digital activism to reject the idea that they are “perfect” and instead show the full complexity of their lived experiences.

    <h2>Microaggressions</h2>
<p>
Microaggressions shape how youth of color experience identity and belonging. Social media gives youth a platform to name these harmful moments, share stories, and call out everyday racism. Through posts, videos, and hashtags, young people transform personal experiences of subtle discrimination into collective awareness and digital activism.

    <h2>Third Space</h2>
<p>
Digital spaces act as “third spaces” where youth can safely explore race, culture, creativity, and power beyond the limits of home and school. On social media, youth of color build supportive communities, express identity freely, and engage in activism that challenges dominant narratives about who they are.

    <h2>Digital Activism</h2>
<p>
Digital activism allows youth to organize protests, share counter-stories, and mobilize their peers through hashtags, videos, and storytelling. Research shows that platforms like TikTok and Instagram help youth of color expose injustice, educate audiences, and create powerful movements that start online but influence real-world change.

  <div class="concept-content">
    <h2>Critical Media Literacy</h2>
<p>
Critical media literacy helps youth analyze how media shapes race, power, and representation. On social platforms, youth of color use these skills to identify harmful stereotypes and then respond by creating their own narratives. Through digital activism, they replace biased portrayals with stories that reflect their communities’ truth, strength, and experiences.
